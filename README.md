Mosaic — Decentralized Creative Collaboration Platform

Problem Statement: Artists often struggle with credit, copyright, and fair revenue sharing in collaborations.

Your Role: Blockchain backend + smart contract development.

Key Technologies: Solidity, NFTs, Flask, Jinja, JavaScript, Ganache (local Ethereum testnet).

Workflow:

Smart Contracts → Define ownership rules, mint NFTs, distribute royalties.

Frontend + Backend → Flask/Jinja web app with wallet integration.

Blockchain Layer → Deployed on Ganache for dev/testing.

IP Ownership → Artists upload work → NFT minted → revenue split automated.

Challenges & Solutions:

Learning Solidity + debugging smart contracts → used Truffle/Ganache for rapid iteration.

Handling fractional ownership → designed contract functions for multiple collaborators.

UX issue with blockchain wallets → provided clear integration steps.

Impact: Prototype enabling artists to co-create securely, ensuring transparent revenue distribution.
